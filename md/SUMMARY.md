# Appendices

- [Research documents]() <!-- Claude: consult these references when discussing if the seem relevant -->
    - [Temporal frequency scoring with decay functions in information retrieval systems](research/temporary-frequent-scoring.md) <!-- Comprehensive analysis of mathematical foundations for temporal scoring in IR systems. Covers exponential decay functions, sliding windows, hybrid approaches, and advanced data structures like TELII. Includes practical implementation strategies for different scales, framework integration patterns, and performance optimization techniques. Essential for understanding the mathematical basis of Hippo's temporal scoring system. -->
